# HealthBox

An open source platform to centralize health information.


## Hosting

While HealthBox is designed to be easily self hosted, V0LT hosts a public HealthBox instance at <https://v0lttech.com/healthbox/landing.php> for conveinence.


## Description

HealthBox is a convenient and private way to manage health information. Instead of each app having to record health data within its own ecosystem, HealthBox creates a place for developers to centralize health information. Say you have a program that records your steps, one that monitors workouts, and a third program to track your food intake. Typically, if you wanted to access your information, you'd have to use each respective service's interface. With HealthBox, those developers are able to store all health information in one place, making it much easier to compare different health metrics, and share information between services securely and privately.

As with other V0LT software, HealthBox places a heavy emphasis on on privacy. HealthBox puts you in full control of your information. Instead of having to trust a third party, as a HealthBox user, you can review every line of code that goes into making the platform function. HealthBox also gives you full control over what services can access what information.
